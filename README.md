### BookSwap App
Assignment Overview
Hey there! This is my BookSwap Flutter app, a platform where students can swap textbooks and other books with each other. No more spending crazy money on books you'll only use for one semester!

### What I've Built So Far
Authentication System
Sign Up/Login with email and password using Firebase Auth

Email verification - users gotta verify their email before they can access the app (security first! 🔒)

Proper error handling for all the common auth issues like wrong passwords, existing emails, etc.

### Core App Features
Browse Books - See all available books posted by other students

My Books - Manage the books I've posted (edit, delete, view details)

Post Books - Easy form to add new books with all the details:

Title, author, condition (New, Like New, Good, Fair, Poor)

Price type (Free, Swap, or set a price)

Subject, description, and book cover image

Bottom Navigation - Smooth navigation between Browse, My Books, Chats, and Settings

### UI/UX Stuff
Clean, intuitive design with our signature red theme

Responsive layouts that work on different screen sizes

Loading states and error handling so users always know what's happening

Empty states with helpful prompts when there's no data

### Technical Backend
Firebase Firestore for real-time data sync

Firebase Authentication for secure user management

State management with Provider pattern

Image handling for book covers

### How It Works
